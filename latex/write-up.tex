\section{Method and Code Design}
\subsection{Testing the simple \enquote{One Parameter} Model}
To test the \enquote{One Parameter} hypothesis the model had to be stripped down to the simpliest form.
Certain assumptions were neccessarily made in order for this model to be simulated. It was assumed that it is possible
to test a single subject multiple times and reasonably predict that the same score will result within a certain std deviation
\todo[inline]{finalise estimation based on normal practices and cite} of some amount which will provide a reliable indicator
of the subjects ability to obtain the score. i.e a reproducable result will be obtained.
