These contain date stamped changes which are possible to check via git diff using the gh-pages branch.\r\n\r\nThat includes the commit history (and messages) for the codes as well as the notes wiki and reading list are also available to view via this website. \r\n\r\n#Initial Test Parameters\r\n\r\n## Gaussian One: Student Ability\r\n\r\nThis Gaussian assumes the student is capable of achieving 60% within a standard deviation of 22.6%. The error estimate made is not fully justified. There is a real possibility the student will fail so this estimate for the standard deviation is likely to be too low when compared with the actual physical data available.\r\n\r\nHowever, the system is trialing the exam scores of a population of students from the Edinburgh University School of Physics and Astronomy, which is [Ranked No. 17 in the world](http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2013#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=) and follows a syllabus which is standardized to conform to the Institute of Physics criteria for accredited British Physics degrees  hence it is expected that a University which only allows the very strongest physics applicants of the world onto to study will in turn find a greater number of student achieve the very highest grades of the country at the end of their degree.\r\n\r\nTo simplify matters. This Study will only look at those courses which are part of a physics degree accredited by the [Institute of Physics](http://www.iop.org/). This will allow a qualitative assessment of the results in context of the county pass fail progression rate at the end of the study.\r\n\r\n * mean: 60%\r\n * std deviation 22.6%\r\n\r\n###Gaussian
