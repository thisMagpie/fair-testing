Associated data and reference material to follow up is also added here for easy reference/\r\n\r\n#Initial Test Parameters\r\n\r\n###Gaussian One: Student Ability\r\n\r\nThis Gaussian assumes the student is capable of achieving 60% within a standard deviation of 22.6%. The error estimate made is not fully justified. There is a possibility the student will fail.\r\n\r\nHowever, our test refers to a population of students from the Edinburgh University School of Physics and Astronomy, which is [Ranked No. 17 in the world](http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2013#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=) and hence only allows the very strongest physics applicants of the world onto to the course it is difficult to decide whether to assume such students are capable of such a significant standard deviation in performance on their exams or whether to allow facts to influence the estimate on the first run of trials.\r\n\r\nTo simplify matters. This Study will only look at those courses which are accredited by the Institute of Engineering \r\n\r\nFor that reason the approach used is used with caution. \r\n\r\nmean: 60%\r\n\r\nstd deviation
